# Sandbox project - Weather App

### Credit to @GreatStack on YouTube.

## Description

This project is a weather app using the OpenWeatherMap API. The user is to enter a city and the API will spit out the weather information for said city.

This project was a 'follow along' and credit to @GreatStack for introducing me to APIs.

## Usage

The user enters a city where the app will feedback the weather information for that city. If nothing is entered or if the app doesn't recognise the city that has been entered, the user will receive that information back and will be asked to try again.
